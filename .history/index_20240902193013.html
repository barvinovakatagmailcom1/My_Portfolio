          <p><strong>My First Steps in Web Development:</strong></p>
          <p>When I started learning web development, it was a real challenge. With a background in mathematics and computer science, I found web development to be an exciting new field.</p>
          <p>I began with the basics—HTML and CSS—which helped me understand how to create simple pages. Then, I moved on to JavaScript. It wasn’t easy at first, but I realized that mistakes are part of learning, and each one made me better.</p>
          <p>Eventually, I learned React, which allowed me to build more complex and dynamic applications. React’s component-based approach made organizing code much easier.</p>
          <p>Seeing the results of my work keeps me motivated. Learning in web development never stops, and that keeps me on my toes. If you're starting your journey in this field, don’t be afraid of challenges and keep learning—your efforts will pay off.</p>
